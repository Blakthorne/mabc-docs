# Overview

## Birds-Eye View

Before we jump into the weeds during the next few chapters, let's take a few moments together to look at the high-level integrations.

<Diagram altText="Auditorium Diagram" imageName="auditorium" label="Auditiorium" />

The diagram above lays out the major components in our audio-visual system, organized by location. Take note that it only represents the locations relationally without regard to their actual location in the building.

## Audio

Audio travels in both [digital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio) and [analog](https://reverb.com/news/how-does-analog-audio-work-basic-pro-audio-concepts) form between the [stage](/audio#stage) and the [sound booth](/audio#sound-booth). Then it is sent from the sound booth to the PA speakers.

## Video

Video and slides follow a slightly less linear path. Presently, video is used at two displaysâ€”the auditorium projector and the Mother's Room TV. An Apple TV plugs into the projector, allowing us to send whatever material from wherever we'd like (e.g. a speaker's iPad or a Mac in the sound booth). The video of the service is also sent in real time, over HDMI, to the TV in the Mother's Room.

## Internet

Internet for the building is all distributed from the Church Office. Ethernet is distributed to several locations around the building via a switch, with switches and Wifi Access Points provided at most of those outlying location as well.
