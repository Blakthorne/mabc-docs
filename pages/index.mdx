## Welcome
 
We're glad to have you on our team! If you're reading this, you are an important part of this church's ministry and we just wanted to take the time to thank you once again for all you're doing. Please take some time to peruse the docs if this is your first visit here. This is intended to be a *one-stop shop* for any tech-related questions you may have regarding our technical setup here at Missouri Avenue Baptist Church.

## Why are we here?

To make it very clear right off the bat, we don't do this for the views. You are providing essential ministries to our church and serve people both within our congregation and outside it.

<Callout>
    This is important work. Please refer to our [Mission Statement](/mission-statement).
</Callout>

We strive to glorify God with our actions, especially when those actions are expressly taken in effort to spread His Word and assist in worship of Him.

### Congregational Ministry

We're helping the service to run smoothly by helping the Pastor and musicians minister. A sound system—even a good one—can be very distracting if run poorly. Part of our goal is to reduce distractions that would shift attention away from worship and the things of God.

    Ideally, nobody really knows we're there.

As we are also a church with a diverse age-demographic, many members are hard of hearing. The ministry you're helping to provide helps those members to hear the Word of God preached.

### Outreach

This ministry is also about capturing what we as members of this body experience each week and providing that to others who aren't physically here with us. Whether it's for a member who was sick on a particular week, an elderly shut-in who can't make the drive, a local Christian looking for a church in the area who wants to watch a service before making the decision to visit, or someone coming across our social media during a good, long doomscrolling session, we want to clearly present the message of each service and accurately reflect the spirit of our church.

    Our job poorly could deflect a viewer from truly hearing the message of the ministry.

## What do we do?

At the moment, there are only a few components to our technical ministries. As we grow, we hope to separate more of the duties and thereby grow them individually.


### Audio

The audio ministry is exactly what it ***sounds*** like. 😅 Running the sound during the services is one of the most obvious things we do. Read on in the [Audio](/audio/overview) chapter.

### Video

Alongside audio is video. This is very simple at the moment—one camera running its video feed straight into the computer. And that's pretty much it, so there isn't a dedicated chapter to the topic at the moment.

### Website

Our [Website](https://missouriavenuebaptistchurch.com/) contains many things—general church information, weekly livestreams, the sermon archive, an events calendar, contact information, etc. Members of the church and those visiting alike use it to get up-to-date information on the happenings of the church.

### Social Media

We mainly use three online platforms—[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkFNNFYs_NiMo6iM0KmgbTg), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/missouriavenuebaptistchurch/), and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/MissouriAvenueBaptistChurch/). We generally make identical posts for church events and updates to put on Instagram and Facebook. We just use both to reach different demographics, and [Meta Business Suite](https://business.facebook.com/latest/home?asset_id=104775599732488&business_id=1063105237670090&nav_ref=bizweb_landing_ig_login_button) makes this very convenient. YouTube houses all our livestreams and any other videos we put together.
