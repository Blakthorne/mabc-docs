# Welcome
 
We're glad to have you on our team! If you're reading this, you are an important part of this church's ministry and we just wanted to take the time to thank you once again for all you're doing. Please take some time to peruse the docs if this is your first vist here. This is intended to be a *one-stop shop* for any tech-related questions you may have regarding our technical setup here at Missouri Avenue Baptist Church.

## Why?

To make it very clear right off the bat, we don't do all this and go to all this trouble to do something impressive or to garner views. These systems provide essential ministies in our church and help to serve people both within our congregation and outside it.

    This is important work. Always remember though, it's for God's glory, not ours. Please refer to our [Mission Statement](/mission-statement).

First of all, we're ministering to those physically in the building during the services. We're helping the service to run smoothly by helping the Pastor and musicians minister in their way. We want to reduce distractions rather and make it seem like we aren't even there, as opposed to making a big show of things.

As we are a church with a diverse age-demographic, we also have many members who are hard of hearing. The ministry you're helping to provide helps those members to hear the Word of God preached.
