## Welcome
 
We're glad to have you on our team! If you're reading this, you are an important part of this church's ministry and we just wanted to take the time to thank you once again for all you're doing. Please take some time to peruse the docs if this is your first visit here. This is intended to be a *one-stop shop* for any tech-related questions you may have regarding our technical setup here at Missouri Avenue Baptist Church.

## Why?

To make it very clear right off the bat, we don't do this for the views. You are providing essential ministries to our church and serve people both within our congregation and outside it.

    This is important work. Please refer to our [Mission Statement](/mission-statement).
</Callout>

We strive to glorify God with our actions, especially when those actions are expressly taken in effort to spread His Word and assist in worship of Him.

### Congregational Ministry

We're helping the service to run smoothly by helping the Pastor and musicians minister in their way. A sound system—even a good one—can be very distracting if run poorly. Part of our goal is to reduce distractions that would shift attention away from worship and the things of God.

    Ideally, nobody really knows we're there.

As we are also a church with a diverse age-demographic, many members are hard of hearing. The ministry you're helping to provide helps those members to hear the Word of God preached.

### Outreach

Another important aspect of this ministry is capturing what we as members of this body experience each week and providing that to others who aren't physically here with us. Whether it's for a member who was sick on a particular week, an elderly shut-in who can't make the drive, a local Christian looking for a church in the area who wants to watch a service before making the decision to visit, or someone coming across our social media during a good, long doomscrolling session, we want to clearly present the message of each service and accurately reflect the spirit of our church.

If we do our job poorly, we have the potential to reflect poorly on our Savior to those watching.
