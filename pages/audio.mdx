# Audio Overview

All things considered, we run a fairly minimal audio system. It's all contained in one room—the Auditorium—so there aren't a lot of dispersed pieces to keep track of. We're definitely not trying to make it complicated for complexity's sake—everything serves a specific role.

We'll start by introducing you to the systems broken down by location.

## The Stage

<Diagram altText="Stage Diagram" imageName="stage" label="Stage" />

In the diagram above, you'll see the equipment that sits on the stage. The [Stagebox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stage_box) is the heart here, sending signal from the microphones to the booth and receiving signal going to the monitors. The receiver for the wireless mics also sits on the stage so it is always in close proximity to the mics—most of the time this is the lapel mic on the speaker.

That covers it for audio. Now let's turn to video. At the moment, we're sending video to the projector via an Apple TV. This enables us to (*usually*) effortlessly send video/slides from an iPad or Mac (which is what we do 😉). The Pastor streams the slides from his iPad, but we can also connect with the Mac in the tech booth, sending video to the projector and audio through the sound system.

## The Mixer

The mixer functions as the heart of the whole system. Everything runs either to or from the mixer, and it controls everything.
