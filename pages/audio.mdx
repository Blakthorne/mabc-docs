# Audio Overview

All things considered, we run a fairly minimal audio system. It's all contained in one room—the Auditorium—so there aren't a lot of dispersed pieces to keep track of. We're definitely not trying to make it complicated for complexity's sake—everything serves a specific role.

    It might be a bit overwhelming at first glance. That's why this site exists!

We'll start by introducing you to the systems broken down by location.


## Stage

### Microphones

We have microphones at various places around the stage (and in the [ceiling](/audio#congregation-mics)), depending on the needs of each service. Except for a couple backup lines, all of these send signal to the sound booth via the [stagebox](/audio#stagebox).

    The backup lines are analog and are usually left unused, but they're there in case the stagebox blows up or something like that 🤷.

### Stagebox

The [stagebox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stage_box) is the heart here, sending signal from the microphones to the booth and receiving signal going to the [stage monitors](/audio#stage-monitors). 

### Wireless Receiver

The receiver for the wireless mics also sits on the stage so it's always in close proximity to the wireless mics—most of the time this is the lapel mic on the speaker.

### Stage monitors

The [stage monitors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stage_monitor_system) are just speakers that sit on the floor, pointing directly at someone to help them hear what is going on across the stage. They receive signal from the [stagebox](/audio#stagebox) and their levels are adjusted at the [mixer](/audio#mixer) in the sound booth. We have two of these set up—one next to the piano and one next to the organ.

### Projector

At the moment, we're sending video to the projector via an Apple TV. This enables us to (*usually*) effortlessly send video/slides from an iPad or Mac (which is what we do 😉). The Pastor streams the slides from his iPad, but we can also connect with the Mac in the sound booth, sending video to the projector and audio through the sound system.

### Stage Network Switch

This switch provides ethernet to the Apple TV.


## Sound Booth

### Mixer

The [mixer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixing_console) functions as the heart of the whole system. Everything runs either to or from the mixer, and it controls pretty much everything. Ours is a
