Purchased in July 2020 from Amazon. Unfortunately, the equipment from this purchase uses the Shure J10 frequency band, which has since been discontinued. However, Shure has provided a [compatibility chart](https://service.shure.com/s/article/BLX-compatibility-H11-J11-J10?language=en_US) listing several overlapping frequencies with the current J11 and H11 bands that we can use when purchasing new equipment. This purchase contained 3 itemsâ€”

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [BLX88 Dual Wireless Receiver for BLX Wireless System](https://www.shure.com/en-US/products/wireless-systems/blx_wireless/blx88?variant=BLX88%253D-J11)

Located on the Stage. The website listing only shows the current J11 frequency band, but we own equipment that uses the obsolete J10 band.

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [BLX1 Bodypack Transmitter](https://www.shure.com/en-US/products/wireless-systems/blx_wireless/blx1?variant=BLX1%253D-J11) (x2)

One in active use, and one used as a backup. Both stored in the Sound Booth. The website listing only shows the current J11 frequency band, but we own equipment that uses the obsolete J10 band.

Purchased in March 2024 from Sweetwater. Used on the stage or in the congregation. Stored in the Sound Booth. Since this mic uses the J11 frequency band, we have to use this [compatibility chart](https://service.shure.com/s/article/BLX-compatibility-H11-J11-J10?language=en_US) when pairing it to channels on our [wireless receiver](http://localhost:3000/equipment-reference#-blx88-dual-wireless-receiver-for-blx-wireless-system).
