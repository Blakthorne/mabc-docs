# Mission Statement

The Audio-Visual ministry of Missouri Avenue Baptist Church aims to serve those within and without our walls, including our local family, fellow believers, and the lost with whom we must share the Gospel. We achieve this mission thusâ€”

* by applying our talents in an act of worship, and thereby aiding our fellow believers in worship,
* by directing the application of technology to further the Gospel of Christ in a humble manner that glorifies Him,
* by volunteering our time to train to be better artisans of our craft,
* by aiding the other ministries of the church during each service, and
* by presenting the ministry of our church in a way that welcomes those seeking Christ or a church home.
