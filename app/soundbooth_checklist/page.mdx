# Soundbooth Checklist

This section provides information that's helpful for running the soundbooth on a weekly basis. We try to keep it updated with our most current procedures.

This section also does not include any information on running the mixer during a serviceâ€”it's meant to serve as a general checklist for whomever is in charge of the equipment setup/teardown and handling tasks on the computer.
