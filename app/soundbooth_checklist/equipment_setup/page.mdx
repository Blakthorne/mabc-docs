# Equipment Setup

If you are working in the sound booth for a service, and you are the first one to arrive, this is all the equipment that needs to be turned on and configured.

<Callout type="warning">
    The order in which some of the equipment is turned on is very important, as, for example, turning the amp on before the mixer could potentially damage the speakers.
