## Audio

### No Sound in the Auditorium

There are a number of issues that could cause the audio to not reach the main speakers. Here are some things to check—

 - The ***Main*** fader on the mixer is set to ***0*** (see [mixer setup](/soundbooth_checklist/equipment_setup#mixer))
 - The amp is turned on (see [amp setup](/soundbooth_checklist/equipment_setup#amp))
 - The amp knobs are at the correct positions—both at ***3*** clicks from the left
 - The wireless receiver on the platform is turned on (see [wireless receiver setup](/soundbooth_checklist/equipment_setup#wireless-receiver))
 - The stagebox on the platform is turned on (see [stagebox setup](/soundbooth_checklist/equipment_setup#stagebox))
    
    You can easily tell whether or not the stagebox is turned on by checking to see if there are any signals coming through on channels 1-8 of the mixer. If there are is no signal coming through on any of those channels, then the stagebox is likely turned off.

    We've also run into an issue before where the stagebox is turned on, but isn't sending any signal to the mixer. If this happens, simply restart the stagebox and it should start working again.

### No Audio on the TVs

If the livestream audio isn't playing on the TVs, follow the steps given in the section on [sending audio to the TVs](/soundbooth_checklist/computer_preparation#send-audio-to-tvs).

If that doesn't fix the issue, you can also check in OBS to make sure that the livestream audio is being played back correctly. Follow these steps—
    1. Click on the audio input source
    2. Click on the gear icon to open the settings for that source
    3. Ensure that the setting ***Output and Monitor*** is selected

## Video

### No Video on the TVs

If the livestream video isn't displaying on the TVs, follow the steps given in the section on [sending video to the TVs](/soundbooth_checklist/computer_preparation#send-video-to-tvs).

### Can't Open OBS Video-Panel Menu

Sometimes the video-panel menu described in the section on [sending video to the TVs](/soundbooth_checklist/computer_preparation#send-video-to-tvs) doesn't appear. This seems to be a bug in OBS, which will hopefully be fixed someday. For now, you can restart the program to fix the issue—it usually starts working again after a single restart.
