## Audio

### No Sound in the Auditorium

There are a number of issues that could cause the audio to not reach the main speakers. Here are some things to check—

 - The ***Main*** fader on the mixer is set to ***0*** (see [mixer setup](/soundbooth_checklist/equipment_setup#mixer))
 - The amp is turned on (see [amp setup](/soundbooth_checklist/equipment_setup#amp))
 - The amp knobs are at the correct positions—both at ***3*** clicks from the left
 - The wireless receiver on the platform is turned on (see [wireless receiver setup](/soundbooth_checklist/equipment_setup#wireless-receiver))
 - The stagebox on the platform is turned on (see [stagebox setup](/soundbooth_checklist/equipment_setup#stagebox))
    
    You can easily tell whether or not the stagebox is turned on by checking to see if there are any signals coming through on channels 1-8 of the mixer. If there are is no signal coming through on any of those channels, then the stagebox is likely turned off.

    We've also run into an issue before where the stagebox is turned on, but isn't sending any signal to the mixer. If this happens, simply restart the stagebox and it should start working again.
